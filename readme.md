## About

ðŸ§° GB4 is a small *swiss army knife* bot for my private discord. It's written using the "new" [PyCord]("https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord") library.

Feel free to copy and paste any of the code to make your own bot, or use the discussions tab for questions about making your own Discord bot with Pycord.

## Install

GB4 isn't made with other servers in mind, but is totally deployable. Repo is public for others to reference, local contributions/issues, and external help.

ðŸ“‚ If you are making a copy for whatever reason...
* `git clone https://github.com/JoshPaulie/goonbot4.git`
* rename .env.example -> .env
  * fill in relevant API keys
* add your server/guild in config.py
  * You can do this by _removing_ my private guilds from the all_servers list and _adding_ your own server(s).
