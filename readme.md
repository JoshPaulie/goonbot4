## About

ðŸ§° GB4 is a small *swiss army knife* bot for my private discord. It's written using the "new" [PyCord]("https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord") library. It's mostly a port of the last GB iteration to the new library, using all of the new Discord API features.

## Install

GB4 isn't made with other servers in mind. It's totally for local use. Repo is public for version control, local contributions/issues, and external help.

ðŸ“‚ If you are making a copy for whatever reason
* `git clone https://github.com/JoshPaulie/goonbot4.git`
* rename .env.example -> .env
  * fill in relevant API keys
* add your server/guild in config.py
